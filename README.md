# computer-vision-final-project
This project was created by Alec Lawlor and Anna Bolger
To use this repository download the source code. To run the main program, navigate to the downloaded folder and run main.py. Doing so will launch a Flask application on your local machine on port 5000. 

In order to train the model with the augmented data set, run the file model.py.

Commands:

'python main.py' : run the Flask application 
'python model.py' : train the ResNet50 model 
'python augment.py' : augment the original dataset

Anna Bolger:
•Configuration of ResNet18 Model
•Configuration of Data

Alec Lawlor:
•Configuration of web cam feed
•Data Augmentation
•Connecting model with Applicatio
